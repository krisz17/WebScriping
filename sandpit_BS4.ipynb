On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output \"12\" as result. Type-checking can be done at two stages - Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.\n",

These data types can be grouped into the following categories- Note: The standard library also includes fractions to store rational numbers and decimal to store floating-point numbers with user-defined precision. Note: The standard library also includes additional types for processing:1. Binary data such as bytearray bytes memoryview , and2. Text strings such as str. A mapping object can map hashable values to random objects in Python. Mappings objects are mutable and there is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.

Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names.Creating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just stuff the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot.
